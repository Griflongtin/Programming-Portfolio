I haven't always wanted to program. But I got into programing because I was interested in engineering and design. When I was younger I joined a robotics team to get some knowledge and experience in engineering but got hooked on programing aspect of robotics. I became one of two programmers on the team. I programmed for two years for the team and then moved on.<br><br> About a year later I found another team. I was the most experienced on the team and did a bit of every thing. I helped write the engineering notebook, helped design and build the robot, excetera excetera.<br><br> I am also a member of the Boy Scouts of America. I have been affiliated with the Scouts of 12 yeas. I am in 2 Boy Scout troops and 2 venture crews and I am also a member of the National Honor Society of the Boy Scout of America or the Order of the Arrow. I volunteer of lots of different events. I also help run and manage mean council wide events.</h4></div>
